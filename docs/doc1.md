## What are Binance Chain and Binance DEX?
Binance Chain is a blockchain software system developed by Binance and its community. Binance DEX refers to the decentralized exchange features developed on top of Binance Chain.

## What can I do with Binance Chain?
The purpose of the new blockchain and DEX is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.

You can:

* Send and receive BNB
* Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use Binance Chain as underlying exchange/transfer network for the assets
Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze, lock/unlock tokens
* Propose to create trading pairs between two different tokens
* Send orders to buy or sell assets through trading pairs created on the chain
* Watch the DEX market to confirm price and market activity of certain assets

You can also:

* Explore the transaction history and blocks on the chain, via Binance Chain Explorer, API and node RPC interfaces.
* Run a full node to listen to and broadcast live updates on transactions, blocks, and consensus activities
* Extract other data of Binance Chain via full node or APIs
* Apply to run a validator node
* Develop tools and application to help users use Binance Chain and Binance DEX
* In the future you may also be able to stake your BNB to join Chain Governance, if you so wish.
