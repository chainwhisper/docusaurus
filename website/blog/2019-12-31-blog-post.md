# Binance Chain 2019 Annual Report

***Check out highlights from Binance Chain’s 2019***

[Binance Chain](binance.org) is a blockchain project initiated by [Binance](binance.com) and has since involved a whole community of Binancians. Binance Chain is designed as an alternative marketplace for issuing, using, and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.
The first use case for Binance Chain is [Binance DEX](https://www.binance.org/en/trade), a new decentralized exchange (DEX) that aims to offer the benefits and security of a DEX and also carry over the best features of an exchange in a decentralized setting. Since launch,  Binance DEX continues to build momentum as the leading global decentralized exchange with your support.
