## REST API

There are Accelerated Nodes which provide advanced API services for the public

Here is a list of all the Rest API information Accelerated Node provides:

### Node RPC

There are data seed nodes in the network which allow users to perform low-level operations like executing ABCI queries, viewing network/consensus state or broadcasting a transaction.
If you run a full node by yourself, you can also use those RPC functions. Here is a list of all the Node RPC services it provides: node-rpc

## Advanced Ways To Use Blockchain

### Run your own full node

Please refer to this guide about how to run your own node.

### Run your own light client

Please refer to this guide about how to run your own light client.

### Access via Node Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface is available for Linux and Mac platforms.<br/>
Please refer to the CLI Reference.

### Use SDKs

SDKs are also provided as a starting point for your apps.<br/>
There are two advanced SDK solutions for Binance chain: [Java](https://github.com/binance-chain/java-sdk) and [Go](https://github.com/binance-chain/go-sdk).<br/>
Both solutions provide functions for:<br/>

- Create wallets and manage keys
- Encode/sign transactions and submit to Binance Chain/DEX, including Transfer, New Order, Cancel Order, etc.
- Communicate with Binance Chain/DEX Node RPC calls through public node RPC services or your own private full nodes

Please refer to specific SDK documentation for more information:
