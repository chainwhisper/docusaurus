Navigate to the Binance Chain Explorer (Testnet)


**What is the Binance Chain Explorer?**
The explorer is a graphic user interface designed to allow users to interact with the blockchain. Through this interface, a user can browse information about blocks that have been added to the blockchain, transactions that have occurred on the blockchain, wallet balances and information about Binance Coin (BNB).
